Work in progress.

* DIRECTORY STRUCTURE *
CMakeLists.txt - setup and build config for cmake. It's contained in every subdir too.
README - build instructions etc.
cmake - additional cmake modules
kalyptus - set of PERL scripts used to create Smoke C++ code
qore - Qore Qt4 bindings module source
  qt4 - module sources
  tools - UI compiler etc.
smoke - Set of script templates for Smoke C++ code
test - Qore Qt4 test scripts, examples and tutorial


* BUILD INSTRUCTIONS *

Requirements:
 - Qt4 with development stuff (includes, qmake...)
 - PERL available in $PATH
 - Cmake

Module is built with debugging symbols only for now. Smoke lib too.

Use so called "out of source" build

 - mkdir build   (in module directory)
 - cd build
 - cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install ..   (if there is not -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX specified, /usr/local is used)
 - make
 - cross fingers
 - make install

Some tests are located in "test" directory.



My build example (mac):
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/qore/ ..
output:
Install the project...
